# Workflow Usage

NomadWorks uses three task complexity levels and three work tracks.

## Complexity

- `tiny`: Minimal, low-risk work.
- `standard`: Default bounded delivery work.
- `complex`: Multi-step work that uses decomposition and the Workflow Runner.

## Track

- `implementation`: Delivery work that changes code, tests, config, or linked docs.
- `investigation`: Discovery and debugging work intended to produce findings.
- `spec`: SCR and specification work.

## Slice set

- `foundation`
- `core`
- `logic`
- `ui`
- `polish`
- `qa`
- `docs`

## Routing rules

- Prefer `tiny` when one specialist can complete the task in one slice with lightweight verification.
- Use `standard` for the normal delivery path when a task is still bounded and does not require decomposition.
- Use `complex` when the work needs an approved SCR, multiple handoffs, or slice-based subtasks.

## SCR Requirement Rules

- `tiny` + `implementation` + non-behavioral change: SCR optional, `scr: null` allowed
- `standard` + `implementation`: SCR required
- `complex` + `implementation`: SCR required
- `spec`: SCR required by definition
- `investigation`: SCR optional unless the work is already formalizing a proposed change

## Team modes

- `mini`: supports `tiny` and `standard` only, using `product_manager`, `business_analyst`, and `tech_lead`
- `full`: supports `tiny`, `standard`, and `complex`, including `workflow_runner`

- `docs/guides/TEAM_MODE_MINI.md`
- `docs/guides/TEAM_MODE_FULL.md`

## Current parallelism rule

- One shared-worktree implementation task may run at a time.
- Investigation and spec tasks may run in parallel when they avoid conflicting edits.

## Task metadata

Task files use lightweight frontmatter to record only durable workflow fields. Use `scr: null` only for `tiny` work that does not change product behavior or shared specifications.

```yaml
---
id: TASK-001
complexity: standard
track: implementation
slice: logic
status: todo
scr: SCR-001
parent: null
assigned_to: product_manager
handoff_from: null
---
```

When PMA, BA, or Tech Lead need to hand workflow-relevant discussion context to one another, use a normal task file with:

- `assigned_to` set to the next responsible agent
- `handoff_from` set to the agent creating the handoff
- a detailed `Discussion Record` section in the task body

Track these task files under `Active Discussions` in `tasks/current.md` until they resolve into execution, SCR work, clarification, or closure.

## Reopen And Resume

- If a task was thought to be done but later needs discrepancies fixed or minor same-scope changes, reopen the same task instead of creating a new one.
- Move it back into `Active` in `tasks/current.md`.
- Keep the same task file ID and record the reason in `Reopen History`.
- Reuse the same Task tool `task_id` for delegated task work when possible.
- If the task used `workflow_runner`, reuse both the same Task tool `task_id` and the same Workflow Runner `session_id` when possible.

## Evidence By Track

- `implementation`: produce the normal evidence packet, including logs, screenshots when relevant, and AC coverage.
- `investigation`: produce findings, reproduction notes, logs when useful, and a recommended next step.
- `spec`: produce SCR and documentation updates that capture the accepted change definition and product/architecture impact.

## Drive-To-Done

When Drive-To-Done is explicitly active, PMA or Workflow Runner continues the current task lifecycle until `DONE`, `HARD BLOCKER`, or `CYCLE LIMIT`.

- `DONE`: Definition of Done is satisfied and closure authority approves the result.
- `HARD BLOCKER`: safe progress is impossible without a specific missing input or external fix.
- `CYCLE LIMIT`: the configured continuation limit is reached before closure.

Drive-To-Done uses existing task files, acceptance criteria, evidence, and registries. It is not a separate workflow model.

SCR files use similarly lightweight frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: SCR-001
status: proposed
tasks: []
---
```

## Documentation lookup

When deciding where documentation belongs:

- use `docs/product/` for whole-product truth
- use `docs/domains/` for stable product areas that contain multiple features
- use `docs/features/` for one concrete capability
- use `docs/architecture/` for technical design and cross-cutting engineering decisions
- use `docs/scrs/` for proposed and approved changes, not steady-state truth

See `docs/core/documentation_structure.md` for the canonical rules.
